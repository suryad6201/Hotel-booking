Hi there..! In this project I have mainly focused on handling flex box and implementing sass in react. 

Hands-on experience: HTML5, CSS3, Flex Box, Sass(SCSS Syntax) Preprocessor, Simple postcss like autoprefixer, Basic BEM Methodology. 

1. Run "npm start"
npm start executes watch:sass to watch the compile sass and start-js to run the react app.

2. Run "npm run build:css"
npm run build:css executes compile:sass prefix:css compress:css

Deployed webapp: https://hotel-booking-project.netlify.app/

Thanks.
